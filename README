This project is still pre-alpha and there is no Install script or databas files or anything. So it's pretty hard to install this on your own server.
Right now only tested on Ubuntu but should work everywhere.

General structure:
This was made be installed on a server at home. It's best if your web server and NAS is the same server, but you can mount a samba share from a diffrent server too.
And symlink that share in the MorfMedia root dir.

On the Client computer you need a modern html5 browser and VLC & DivX webplayer.
